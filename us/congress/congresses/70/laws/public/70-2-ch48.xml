    <para>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>Fee title to land subject to limited rights, but not for business purposes, reserved to the grantor; provided, that such reservation of rights shall not continue beyond the life or lives of the grantor or grantors of the fee; Provided further, that in the opinion of said Commission the permanent public park purposes for which control over said land is needed are not essentially impaired by said reserved rights and that there is a substantial saving in cost by acquiring said land subject to said limited rights as compared with the cost of acquiring unencumbered title thereto; and</text>
