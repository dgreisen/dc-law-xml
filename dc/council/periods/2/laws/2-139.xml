      <text>An employee may appeal a final agency decision affecting a performance rating which results in removal of the employee (pursuant to subchapter XIII-A of this chapter), an adverse action for cause that results in removal, reduction in force (pursuant to subchapter XXIV of this chapter), reduction in grade, placement on enforced leave, or suspension for 10 days or more (pursuant to subchapter XVI-A of this chapter) to the Office upon the record and pursuant to other rules and regulations which the Office may issue.

      <text>All decisions of the Office shall include findings of fact and a written decision, as well as the reasons or basis for the decision upon all material issues of fact and law presented on record, and order; provided, however, that the Office may affirm a decision without findings of fact and a written decision. Such decisions shall be published in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Office, and shall be published in the District of Columbia Register. Any decision by a Hearing Examiner shall be made within 120 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, from the date of the appellant’s filing of the appeal with the Office. Within 45 days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, after the appeal is filed with the Office, the Office shall determine whether, in accordance with this section and the Office’s own rules, the Office has jurisdiction. Any decision shall include a statement of any further process available to the appellant including, as appropriate, a petition for review or a petition for enforcement and judicial review. Copies of the decision shall be immediately transmitted to the Office and all parties to the appeal, including named parties and intervenors. The initial decision of the Hearing Examiner shall become final 35 days after issuance, unless a party files a petition for review of the initial decision with the Office within the 35-day filing period. In accordance with § <cite path="§1-604.04">1-604.04</cite>, the Office may promulgate rules to allow a Hearing Examiner a reasonable extension of time if extraordinary circumstances dictate that an appeal cannot be decided within the 120-day period. After issuing the initial decision, the Hearing Examiner shall retain jurisdiction over the case only to the extent necessary to correct the record, rule on a motion for attorney fees, or process any petition for enforcement filed under the authority of the Office. If the Office denies all petitions for review, the initial decision shall become final upon the issuance of the last denial. If the Office grants a petition for review, the subsequent decision of the Office shall be the final decision of the Office unless the decision states otherwise. Administrative remedies are considered exhausted when a decision becomes final in accordance with this section.</text>

    <heading>Credit for prior law enforcement service.</heading>
    <text>In computing length of service of a retiring lateral law enforcement officer hired pursuant to § <cite path="§1-610.72">1-610.72</cite>, credit shall be granted for prior law enforcement service outside the Metropolitan Police Department only if the lateral law enforcement officer has deposited to the credit of the Police Officers’ and Firefighters’ Retirement Fund an amount that is equal to the dollar increase in the present value of future benefits which results from crediting the prior service. The calculation of the present value of future benefits shall be based on the actuarial assumptions and methods used to calculate the present value of future benefits from § <cite path="§1-907.03">1-907.03</cite>(a)(3)(B) for the applicable fiscal year. Upon separation from District law enforcement duty for reasons other than retirement, any law enforcement officer who purchased prior service credit shall receive that purchase amount along with any interest credited on the amount. Any law enforcement officer that withdraws the purchase amount and is later reinstated shall not be entitled to this prior service credit until the purchase amount plus interest is again deposited.</text>

    <text>The period of compensation payable under the schedule in § <cite path="§1-623.07">1-623.07</cite> is reduced by the period of compensation paid or payable under the schedule for an earlier injury if: (1) Compensation in both cases is for disability of the same member or function or different parts of the same member or function or for disfigurement; and (2) the Mayor finds that compensation payable for the later disability, in whole or in part, would duplicate the compensation payable for the preexisting disability. In such a case, compensation for disability continuing after the scheduled period starts on the expiration of that period as reduced under this section.</text>

      <text>It is the purpose of this subchapter to establish a financially sound and equitable program of employee retirement benefits. With respect to retirement systems, the Council recognizes that existing programs, including the program administered by the federal government, are not now financed on an actuarially sound basis. Furthermore, the rights and benefits conferred by these systems and the financial implications for participation by employees vary significantly among systems.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>The responsibility for creating an actuarially sound financial plan for existing retirement systems cannot and should not be borne solely by the District government. The Council therefore fully endorses the proposition that the federal government must assist the District government in establishing and maintain the necessary financial base for all existing retirement systems.</text>
