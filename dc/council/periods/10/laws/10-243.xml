        <text>“(a) The Council of the District of Columbia hereby finds: (1) That the quality of life for those citizens who require housing assistance is inextricably linked to safe and affordable housing; (2) That quality public housing sustains and creates opportunities for self-sufficiency, and social and economic improvement; (3) That the inability of some residents to provide shelter for themselves and their families compels them to live in unsafe and unhealthy conditions; and (4) That these conditions are detrimental to the health and welfare of District residents and adversely affect the economy of the District.</text>
        <text>“(b) The Council determines that it is necessary and in the public interest to create an independent housing authority in the District of Columbia and to confer and vest in the authority all powers necessary or appropriate in order that it may engage in providing and maintaining quality public housing in the District of Columbia.”</text>
