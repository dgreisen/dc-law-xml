    <heading>Exemption by consent of tenants.</heading>
    <text>Section 6-731.01   shall not apply to any person performing any alteration upon any housing accommodation if the tenants of unvacated rental units, which are the subject of notices to vacate and which can reasonably be expected to be caused by the alteration to come to be in substantial violation (or, if already in substantial violation, to be in greater violation) of the housing regulations of the District of Columbia for a period of time in excess of 24 hours, agree in writing to the alteration after receiving written notice of the alteration and its effect upon the habitability of the affected units.</text>

    <heading>Exemption by Mayor.</heading>
    <text>The Mayor of the District of Columbia, or his designee, may grant an exemption from the provisions of § <cite path="§6-731.01">6-731.01</cite> in the event he, or his designee, inspects a housing accommodation wherein there are unvacated units subject to a notice to vacate and finds that a proposed alteration, while it may cause such a rental unit to come to be in substantial violation (or, if already in substantial violation, to be in greater violation) of the housing regulations of the District of Columbia for a period of time in excess of 24 hours, is, nevertheless, necessary for the immediate safety of the habitants of the accommodation.</text>
