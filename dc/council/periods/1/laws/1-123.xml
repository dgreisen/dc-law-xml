        <annotation>“(a) For the purposes of this section, the term ‘full service retail service station’ means any retail service station location which provides a garage, service bay, work area, or similar enclosed area for repairing, maintaining, servicing, or otherwise working on motor vehicles, or any service islands. Such repair, maintenance, and service work may include, but is not limited to, the installation or replacement of batteries, tires, fan belts, lights, brakes, water pumps, mufflers and other parts and accessories and the performance of motor oil changes, lubrications, wheel alignments, tune-ups, tire repairs, brake adjustments, and general repair and maintenance work and services.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(b) No retail service station which is operated as a full service retail service station on or after April 19, 1977, may be structurally altered, modified, or otherwise converted, irrespective of the type or magnitude of the alteration, modification, or conversion, including, but not limited to, any alteration, modification, or conversion which has the effect of merely obstructing access to an existing garage, service bay, work area, or similar enclosed area by any motor vehicle which was previously accommodated, into a non-full service facility until October 1, 1999.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(c) No person who is an operator of any full service retail service station on or after April 19, 1977, including any person who is a subsequent operator of any such retail service station, or who, in any manner, controls the operation of any such retail service station, shall substantially reduce the number, types, quantity, or quality of the repair, maintenance, and other services, including the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products, previously offered until October 1, 1999. Such operators shall maintain the retail service station’s existing garages, service bays, work areas, and similar areas in a fully operational condition and reasonably equipped to perform repair, maintenance, and service work on motor vehicles, including the provision of a qualified individual or individuals who is or are capable of performing repair, maintenance, and service work on motor vehicles during a reasonable number of hours per day and of days per week. This subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting any person who operates or controls a full service retail service station from discontinuing the retail sale of motor fuels at such retail service station, provided that less than 20 per centum of such retail service station’s gross revenue derived from the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products and from the repair, maintenance, and servicing of motor vehicles is derived from the retail sale of motor fuels, and provided further that such discontinuance of the retail sale of motor fuels shall not authorize any other substantial reduction in repair, maintenance, or other services previously offered. This subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting a full service retail service station from selling motor fuels on a self-service basis, provided that such retail service station continues to sell motor fuels on a non-self-service basis.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(d)(1) A petition for exemption shall be filed with the Mayor by both a distributor and a retail dealer (‘petitioners’). The Mayor may grant an exemption to the prohibitions contained in subsections (b) and (c) of this section if the petitioners agree in writing that the distributor will perform the following:</annotation>
        <annotation>“(A) Structurally alter, modify, or otherwise convert a retail service station, irrespective of the type or magnitude of the alteration, modification, or conversion, including, but not limited to, any alteration, modification, or conversion that has the effect of merely obstructing access to an existing garage, service bay, work area, or similar enclosed area by any motor vehicle that was previously accommodated, into a non-full service facility; or</annotation>
        <annotation>“(B) Substantially reduce the number, type, quantity, or quality of repairs, maintenance, and other services including the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products; and</annotation>
        <annotation>“(C) Certify that a station is experiencing financial hardship; or</annotation>
        <annotation>“(D) Certify that there is another retail service station within 1 mile of the station that provides equivalent service facilities; and</annotation>
        <annotation>“(E) Certify that the distributor will improve the station in the following ways:</annotation>
        <annotation>“(i) Improve or increase the lighting of the facility;</annotation>
        <annotation>“(ii) Improve customer accessibility to the gasoline dispensers; and</annotation>
        <annotation>“(iii) Improve customer conveniences including separate mens and womens restroom facilities, a working air hose for automobile and bicycle tires, and water for windshield cleaning equipment.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(2) The Mayor shall issue a determination on the petition within 45 days after the date the petition is submitted and deemed complete. If the Mayor does not issue a recommendation within the 45 days the petition shall be deemed approved.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(e)(1) Within 30 days of the effective date of the Paternity Acknowledgment and Gas Station Advisory Board Re-establishment Emergency Act of 1996, the Mayor shall appoint a Gas Station Advisory Board to make recommendations on petitions for exemptions. The Board shall consist of 5 members: One representing the retail service station dealers, 1 representing the oil companies, 2 representing the consumer interest, and 1 representing the Mayor.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(2) The Board shall establish and publish, for 30 days comment, the rules and procedures which shall govern its conduct.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(3) The Board may establish and publish, for 30 days comment, additional criteria which shall be used in reviewing the petitions for exemptions.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(f) The Mayor shall study the motor vehicle repair, maintenance, and other services being offered by existing full service retail stations and non-full service retail service stations to residents, commercial establishments, commuters, and other affected persons in the District of Columbia, both in terms of adequacy and in terms of convenience. This study shall include an analysis of the impact of converting existing full service retail service stations to non-full service retail service stations in various areas of the District of Columbia. The Mayor shall study the adequacy of existing retail service stations to serve the needs and convenience of residents, commercial establishments, commuters, and other affected persons with respect to the retail sale of motor fuels, petroleum products, and automotive products in various areas of the District of Columbia. The study shall include an examination of the petroleum products and automotive products being offered by commercial establishments other than retail service stations. The Mayor shall, if necessary, present to the Council a preliminary report within 30 days after September 21, 1988. A final report detailing the findings of the study, including the Mayor’s recommendations or proposals with respect to any necessary or desirable legislation or other actions, shall be submitted to the Council no later than June 1, 1989.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(g) Any person, including the principal officers or agents of a corporation or association, who falsely certifies a petition for exemption, or willfully or knowingly fails to provide information required by this act, or intentionally provides misleading information required by this act, upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500, but not more than $2,000, for each offense.</annotation>
        <annotation>“(h) The Mayor shall, pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 15 of Title 1 issue rules to implement the provisions of this act which shall include a requirement that each petition for exemption include an estimated date of completion for each phrase of a full service retail station conversion.”</annotation>
