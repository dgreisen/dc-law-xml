    <heading>Purpose.</heading>
    <text>The purpose of this subchapter is to promote the health, safety and welfare of District of Columbia (“District”) residents, to afford the fullest possible preservation and protection of the environment through a requirement that the environmental impact of proposed District government and privately initiated actions be examined before implementation and to require the Mayor, board, commission, or authority to substitute or require an applicant to substitute an alternative action or mitigating measures for a proposed action, if the alternative action or mitigating measures will accomplish the same purposes as the proposed action with minimized or no adverse environmental effects.</text>
