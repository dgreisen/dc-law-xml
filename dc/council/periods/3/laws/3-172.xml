      <text>A Monte Carlo night party means an event for raising funds for charitable purposes at which wagers are made, through the use of imitation money presented to a participant in exchange for a donation to the event, in games of chance customarily associated with a gambling casino and at which a participant may use any accumulated imitation money to purchase prizes at the end of the event. The term “Las Vegas night party” may also be used to describe this type of event.</text>

      <text>The Board shall issue proposed rules, pursuant to subchapter I of Chapter 5 of Title 2, to implement the provisions of this section. In developing the proposed rules, the Board shall not permit any person, firm, partnership, association, organization, or corporation to sponsor, conduct, or hold more than 2 Monte Carlo night parties in a calendar year, shall place a maximum monetary value amount on the prizes that may be offered, and shall mandate that there be no direct correlation between the amount of imitation money presented to a participant and the participant’s donation to the event.
