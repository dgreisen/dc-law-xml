    <heading>New and revised standards.</heading>
    <text>The Mayor may adopt rules to establish increased efficiency standards for the products listed in § <cite path="§8-1771.02">8-1771.02</cite> or efficiency standards for products not specifically listed in § <cite path="§8-1771.02">8-1771.02</cite> if he or she determines that increased efficiency standards would serve to promote energy conservation in the District of Columbia; provided, that no new or increased efficiency standards shall become effective in less than one year following the adoption of the rule establishing the efficiency standard; provided further, that a substantially identical standard shall have been adopted by statute or regulation in Maryland or Virginia. The Mayor may apply for a waiver of federal preemption in accordance with federal procedures under section 325 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, approved December 22, 1975 (89 Stat. 923; 42 U.S.C. § 6295  ), for state efficiency standards for any product regulated by the federal government.</text>

      <text>Within 365 days of the date that the United States Department of Energy issues a final rule on liquid-immersed distribution transformers, the Public Service Commission shall adopt a rule governing the purchase of liquid-immersed distribution transformers by the electric company. The rule shall ensure that, subject to availability, all such purchases occurring on or after January 1, 2009 are based on the life-cycle cost methodology contained in section 2 of Standard TP 1-2002 published by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. The Public Service Commission may also consider additional inventory management costs as costs for inclusion within the life-cycle cost methodology to be used by an electric company for purposes of this section. Except as provided herein, the rule shall be consistent with regulations pertaining to liquid-immersed distribution transformers adopted by the United States Department of Energy.</text>
